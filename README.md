HELLO WORLD -
This is my readme file I've created on VSCode - hope this works.

Outline for Recipe Website

Site Specific:
Some site specific stuff... we need the name of the cooking website, probably a logo or a header photo, a nav bar with links to other recipes and then social media links can either be in the footer area or header, copyright is in the footer area

Ideally
- logo of website either above or below title
- cooking website title (h1)
- navbar with links to pages on website
- searchbar should be in there somewhere in the header as well
- then footer with copyright etc at the bottom - i think i might put socials on the bottom too 

Recipe Specific:
Now to think about what we need for the recipe... we need the title of the recipe, cooking and prep times, maybe calories if I can find it (or make it up), then we need a backstory, ingredients, step-by-step by process, sections of the sandwich etc

Ideally
- name of recipe (h1) and quick intro (prep + cooking time)
- backstory (h2) --- EDIT: i removed this because it looked fine without a heading 
- ingredients (h2)
    - for the marinade (h3)
    - for the breading (h3)
    - for the mayo (h3) which can be optional
    - and of course... (h3) // this will be pickles + japanese milk buns which will include a link and claim theres a recipe on the website for it (optional)

Preparation (h2)
- making the mayo (h3)
    - no need for another heading, just paragraph here
- marinating the chicken(h3)
    - whisk (h4)
        - (p) making the marinade
    - submerge (h4)
        - (p) submerging the chicken
- breading the chicken(h3)
    - whisk breading (h4)
    - coating chicken (h4)

- frying the chicken(h2)
    - frying set up (h3)
    - frying process (h3)
    - cooling process (h3)

- assembly (h2)
    - finishing touches (h3) 
        - this is gonna be slicing pickles + toasting bun (p)
    - assemble (h3)
        - assembling the sandwich (p)
